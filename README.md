## Course Project - EE-798Q - Prof. Tushar Sandhan - Foundations of Inferential Statistics and Automation
### KeyPoints of Project -
#### 1-Developed a LSTM Model, an improved Recurrent Neural Networks(RNNS) for stock value prediction, 
utilizing a decade of training data to accurately recognize patterns and forecast future values with a 2-day horizon
#### 2-Attained 86% Directional Accuracy in LSTM modelâ€™s future value prediction by minimizing the MSE of predictions
#### 3-Utilized Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Keras, TensorFlow) for training the model, predicting stock values
